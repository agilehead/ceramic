Ceramic
=======

Based on JSON-Schema, ceramic can map simple JSON into domain entities used in the application. It can also validate entities against constraints specified in the schema.

Ceramic also comes with two optional batteries, ceramic-db (https://github.com/nodejam/ceramic-db) and ceramic-http-parser (https://github.com/nodejam/ceramic-http-parser). Ceramic-db is an Object Document Mapper (ODM). Ceramic-http-parser parses an HTTP request and converts it into a complex-type using ceramic.
