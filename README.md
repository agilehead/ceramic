Ceramic
=======
Ceramic can convert a simple object into a complex-type based on its associated JSON schema. It can also validate an object against its schema. 

Ceramic also comes with two optional batteries, ceramic-db (https://github.com/jeswin/ceramic-db) and ceramic-http-parser (https://github.com/jeswin/ceramic-http-parser). Ceramic-db is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) with a clean generators based API. Ceramic-http-parser parses and HTTP request and converts it into a complex-type using ceramic.
